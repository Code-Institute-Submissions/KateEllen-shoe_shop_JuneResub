## Site Structure

The aim of the site is offer an easy to navigate and accesible uer experience.
The different elements on the site (header/footer/nav links) remain the same across the site but will be displayed differently from mobile to other devices. The header will always contain a link to the products page and different links based on whether a user is logged in or a super*user.

### Other links:
* User not logged in: 
    * Register
    * Login

* Logged in:
    * My Profile
    * Shopping Bag
    * Logout

    * **Only as superuser** 
        * Admin (dropdown)
            * My profile
            * Explore management
            * Product management

### Wireframes 

The wireframes of the site can be found in the following links: 

* [Homepage]()
* [All products]()
* [Product detail]()
* [Profile]()
* [Bag]()
* [Checkout]()

The final result is slightly different as during the development stage the way things were displayed was not as user friendly as expected.
